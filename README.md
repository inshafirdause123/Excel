This project presents an advanced Excel dashboard that compares sales data between Amazon and Flipkart. The dashboard consolidates and visualizes large datasets to provide actionable insights into e-commerce performance. It tracks key KPIs such as Total Revenue, Average Order Value, and Customer Ratings for both platforms, displayed through interactive KPI cards. Multiple visualizations are included, such as bar charts for top product categories, line charts for monthly sales trends, pie and donut charts for payment method distribution and top products, and area charts for city-wise performance. Additionally, a comparative bar chart highlights category-wise revenue differences between Amazon and Flipkart.

The dashboard is fully interactive, enabled by Excel slicers that allow users to filter by platform and product categories, instantly updating all visuals. Techniques used include Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, DAX-style formulas in Excel, conditional formatting, data modeling, and VBA for shape linking. The design focuses on a clean and modern theme, making the insights visually appealing and easy to interpret.

Through this project, I demonstrated skills in data cleaning, sales analysis, and visualization in Excel, while also showcasing the ability to build dynamic dashboards for business decision-making. The final output allows stakeholders to answer important questions such as:

Which platform performs better in different product categories?

How do sales trends vary month to month?

What payment methods drive the highest revenue?

Which products and locations contribute the most to sales?

This dashboard can serve as a blueprint for real-world business reporting, competitor analysis, and performance tracking in the e-commerce sector.
